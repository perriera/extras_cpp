     *             scenario that the methods would be engaged in
     *             to accomplish a given purpose (of the interface)
     *
     *             in this way you can make refinements to
     *             the interface's methods until you are
     *             satisfied with each method signature
     *
     *             remember, the primary benefit of dock/molds
     *             are that you were able to determine just what
     *             each method was needed and what parameters
     *             that were *actually* required *without*
     *             writing any implementation code.
     *
     *             your appreciation for doing things this way
     *             comes with practice, (aka. practice makes
     *             perfect). the appreciation for this method
     *             really can only be realized in production
     *             environments, (aka. doing thing this way
     *             really can't be passed from teacher to
     *             student in school/university settings)
     *             that is, short of a thesis.
     *
     *               " When the student is ready,
     *                   the teacher will appear. "
